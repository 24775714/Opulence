We are passing a sub repo as its interface, which could be a problem because we're relying on it implementing non-interface methods like hashPassword()
Need to be able to deauthorize all LoginTokens and PasswordTokens
Need to be able to update a user's password, which would involve deauthorizing all LoginTokens and PasswordTokens
Think about what logic would need to be added to detect that the user entered a recently-changed password so we can remind them
Need to build classes to store credentials clientside (eg cookies/JSON)
    Where should these classes be instantiated/used?
Build Session class to try making calls to login/logout
    Make sure everything in Redis/PostgreSQL is being set correctly
Need to build classes that instantiate our repos/factories
Really need to take a look at DBUnit for this stuff because this is only going to get harder and harder to write tests for
Add a layer in front of the server connection layers
    This will allow us to one day add in load balancers
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
Need to add logic to actually authenticate requests with api keys and HMACs

Write tests for router class
    Obviously, we'll then need to write methods
    Allow regular expressions to be passed into router
        Look to Klein and Slim as good references
    Need to add support for different types of users getting routed to different templates
    Need to consider where router object would go (probably the Website object??)
    Need to reconsider having Request as a separate class from Page
        They really are both responses to an HTTP request, but each serves up different kinds of content
            Composition would probably be better-suited than inheritance because an AJAX request response isn't really the same thing as an HTTP page request response
