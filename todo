HAS PRIORITY:
    Convert Generic template's tags to php loops/if-statements
    Turn various components into Composer packages
    Move Config README stuff into their own READMEs
        Focus on how to instantiate classes directly
    *** Once above is done, create a tag



PROBLEM!!!!
    Configs try and instantiate classes sometimes when the name is specified as a string
        Right now, it does the naive way of not passing in anything to the constructor
        What about the case that something is required in the constructor
        Configs won't work in this case
Need to create session storage classes
    Need to think of how to assign session Ids
    For cache-backed sessions, maybe it's best to have a simple ICache for Redis and Memcached to to implement
        This would only include the basics: get(), set(), and delete()
Add a class like "ConfigConverter" to make it easy to translate class names to objects in configs
    Would help reduce code duplication
Allow caching of routes/matches
Be able to generatePath() for a router for use in templates
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
