HAS PRIORITY:
    Need to add a url() template function
        Would need to add URLGenerator dependency
        This would tie Views to Routing.  Is this what I want?
        Other option is to require that this data gets injected into template
            Is this going to get super annoying?  I'm thinking so.
    Need to consider whether or not to remove Config from Database classes
        I think this is one place that they might prove useful, but think about it
    Rethink how we add css/js to templates
        Shouldn't have to have methods in the Template class
        Add built-in template methods to display CSS/JS
            Question is how/where do we specify the list of CSS/JS files for the header/footer?

Need to add more TypeMapper methods
Need to create session storage classes
    Need to think of how to assign session Ids
    For cache-backed sessions, maybe it's best to have a simple ICache for Redis and Memcached to to implement
        This would only include the basics: get(), set(), and delete()
Do we really need repo interface examples in RDev?
    Is this best left for Project?
Implement at least a basic console kernel
Allow caching of routes/matches
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
