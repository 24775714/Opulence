HUGE PROBLEM:  How do we only search for functions to replace that are actual function calls and not calls in the middle of strings?
    For example, '$request->isPath("/docs(/.*)?", true)' is trying to run a view function "docs", which isn't correct at all
    This is a big problem.  Really need to think this through and determine if there's a solution or if I have to rethink how I lex views.
