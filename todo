HAS PRIORITY:
    Add ability to start a section and show it
        Basically, allows us to define a section and give it default content
    Add ability to include a file with {% include("Quotes.php") %}
    Find way to display PHP variables inside tags
    Need to consider whether or not to remove Config from Database classes
        I think this is one place that they might prove useful, but think about it

Need to be able to select DB index for Redis after making connection
    Right now, it's tied to the server object
    So, what gets returned if we connect with a server object, change the DB index, and then request the server object?
Need to add more TypeMapper methods
Need to create session storage classes
    Need to think of how to assign session Ids
    For cache-backed sessions, maybe it's best to have a simple ICache for Redis and Memcached to to implement
        This would only include the basics: get(), set(), and delete()
Do we really need repo interface examples in RDev?
    Is this best left for Project?
Implement at least a basic console kernel
Allow caching of routes/matches
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
