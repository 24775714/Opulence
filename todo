For v1.0.0-alpha1


For v1.0.0-alphaX
    * Add ability to bind unescaped statements to UPDATE/INSERT queries
        * Best way might be to introduce some new PDO::PARAM_* constant like PARAM_UNESCAPED
        * When detecting that it is of type PARAM_UNESCAPED, rather than binding a "?" in AugmentingQueryBuilder, just bind the actual value
        * Would also have to look at how this would be done for SELECT query binding
Finish form stuff

For v1.1.0
    * Need to add way to test Middleware (1.0)
    * Get rid of dependence on HTTP Request in Credential stuff
