Write tests for router class
    Obviously, we'll then need to write methods
    Allow regexes to be passed into router
        Look to Klein and Slim and good references
    Need to add support for different types of users getting routed to different templates
    Need to consider where router object would go (probably the Website object??)
    Need to reconsider having Request as a separate class from Page
        They really are both responses to an HTTP request, but each serves up different kinds of content
            Composition would probably be better-suited than inheritance because an AJAX request response isn't really the same thing as an HTTP page request response
Think more about Tokens class
    As is, it is useful for things like validating an authentication token, but doesn't offer methods useful for storage to repositories (HMAC is meant for verification, not storage in repos)
Implement SQLRepo for Tokens
    This will involve hashing the token before storing it - I need to write code to do this
Find way to pass in private user key to Token repos
Implement Credentials concrete class
Implement credentials validator
Add a layer in front of the server connection layers
    This will allow us to one day add in load balancers
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
Need to add logic to actually authenticate requests with api keys and HMACs
