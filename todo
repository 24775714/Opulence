HAS PRIORITY:
    Move bindings to a bindings file, include it in the bootstrap
    Be able to catch various errors and render different views depending on the error
    Don't return response from controller before applying post-filters
        Post-filters should accept the response as a parameter


Need to write tests for factories
Need to think through not always sharing parameter objects in makeNew()
    For example, if we makeNew() a repo, we need a UoW, which needs to be shared
    However, makeNew() will make a new UoW for each repo, which defeats the purpose
Need to think through MVC
    Login page could use multiple controllers, depending on the action taken
    Do they all extend a common "LoginController", which would setup the view?
    Where does the common-view-setup happen?
Need default controller support in Router
Need a fail-safe method in controllers
Add a class like "ConfigConverter" to make it easy to translate class names to objects in configs
    Would help reduce code duplication
Allow caching of routes/matches
Be able to generatePath() for a router for use in templates
Once the above is done, need to finish Login controller
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Need to add support for host in routers
Do we need a Session object?
    Probably, just seems weird after all this because I haven't looked at it in a long time
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Cache rendered templates
Convert test pages to views/controllers
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
