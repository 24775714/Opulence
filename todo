Think of stuff to throw in the application and application config
Work on router
Be able to call controller from router using syntax similar to Laravel: "MyController::registerUser"
Convert test pages to views/controllers
Need to write some interfaces around LoginCredentials and its factory to generalize them
    This will make classes like LoginController and Session able to work with different types of credentials
See if current Session class would make more sense as an abstract class
    Also need to add methods for setting things like cookies/JSON response for credentials
    Need to pass a reference to this object to LoginController
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to build classes to store credentials client-side (eg cookies/JSON)
    Where should these classes be instantiated/used?
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
