Add more built-in functions for templates like:
    abs
    ceil
    count
    date
    floor
    implode
    json_encode
    round
    ucwords
    urlencode
Make Config extend ArrayObject because, otherwise, it's missing features by only implementing ArrayAccess
Add FileSystem class for reading/writing to files
Investigate using PSR4 in composer.json to autoload
Investigate Travis.yml, too
Switch to Monolog for logging
Need to write some interfaces around LoginCredentials and its factory to generalize them
    This will make classes like LoginController and Session able to work with different types of credentials
See if current Session class would make more sense as an abstract class
    Also need to add methods for setting things like cookies/JSON response for credentials
    Need to pass a reference to this object to LoginController
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Write tests for Router class
Need to build classes to store credentials client-side (eg cookies/JSON)
    Where should these classes be instantiated/used?
Need to build classes that instantiate our repos/factories
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
