HAS PRIORITY:
    Add ability to start a section and show it
        Basically, allows us to define a section and give it default content
    PROBLEM:  We call "extract()" BEFORE we've run the "addParent()" calls prepended by the transpiler.  So, the child view's variables are not getting extracted before everything is getting compiled.  We'd have to potentially re-extract vars (seems sloppy).  Need to investigate more.
        Need to inherit vars BEFORE transpile() returns.  Cannot simply transpile to PHP code because we cannot reference the view being transpiled.  Don't want to write that to variable for fear of concurrency issues when compiling parent views.

    Add support for multiple server objects in Redis.  Also add support for cluster.
    Run checksetup.php ONLY on post create-project script
    Need to add way to test Middleware (1.0)
    Get rid of dependence on HTTP Request in Credential stuff
    Finish form stuff
