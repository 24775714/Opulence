Add ability to bind unescaped statements to UPDATE/INSERT queries
    Best way might be to introduce some new PDO::PARAM_* constant like PARAM_UNESCAPED

    Would also have to look at how this would be done for SELECT query binding
Need to add cluster AND multiple-client support for Redis (two different things)
    Issue is that this will potentially require multiple Client objects

    Add ability to set prefixes in Server objects
        Add ability to set ANY option in array, use this array to set all the appropriate data in Redis
