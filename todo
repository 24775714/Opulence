Add ability to bind unescaped statements to UPDATE/INSERT queries
    Best way might be to introduce some new PDO::PARAM_* constant like PARAM_UNESCAPED
    When detecting that it is of type PARAM_UNESCAPED, rather than binding a "?" in AugmentingQueryBuilder, just bind the actual value
    Would also have to look at how this would be done for SELECT query binding
Need to finalize view library name, console name
Need to add way to test Middleware (1.0)
Get rid of dependence on HTTP Request in Credential stuff
Finish form stuff
