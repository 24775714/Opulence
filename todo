Add ability to instantiate controllers from router
    How without resorting to service locator?  Do some research.
        Biggest hurdle is resolving dependencies in controller constructor
    Need to use reflection to pass in variables in $matches to appropriate parameters in controller
Need to write tests for Router
Allow caching of routes/matches
Be able to generatePath() for a router for use in templates
Consider using Configs for controllers
    In the config, you'd specify the repos, credentials to use
Once the above is done, need to finish Login controller
    Waiting on ways to resolve dependencies in constructor, first
Think of more application config data, update ApplicationConfig::isValid()
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Cache rendered templates
Convert test pages to views/controllers
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
