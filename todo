HAS PRIORITY:
    Be able to catch various errors and render different views depending on the error
    Don't return response from controller before applying post-filters
        Post-filters should accept the response as a parameter
    Move Config README stuff into their own READMEs
        Focus on how to instantiate classes directly
    *** Once above is done, create a tag



PROBLEM!!!!
    Configs try and instantiate classes sometimes when the name is specified as a string
        Right now, it does the naive way of not passing in anything to the constructor
        What about the case that something is required in the constructor
        Configs won't work in this case
Need to think of a good place to instantiate Compiler and Cache
    Create a factory class?  Maybe make the factory class configurable?
        Maybe controller classes will be passed them in their constructors?
        That way, you could call $this->viewFactory->create()->...->render();
    Or make a view config class with those settings?
        Could have lottery-definition for cache
        Could specify instance/name of compiler/cache classes
Need to create session storage classes
    Need to think of how to assign session Ids
    For cache-backed sessions, maybe it's best to have a simple ICache for Redis and Memcached to to implement
        This would only include the basics: get(), set(), and delete()
Need to think through not always sharing parameter objects in makeNew()
    For example, if we makeNew() a repo, we need a UoW, which needs to be shared
    However, makeNew() will make a new UoW for each repo, which defeats the purpose
Need to think through MVC
    Login page could use multiple controllers, depending on the action taken
    Do they all extend a common "LoginController", which would setup the view?
    Where does the common-view-setup happen?
Need default controller support in Router
Need a fail-safe method in controllers
Add a class like "ConfigConverter" to make it easy to translate class names to objects in configs
    Would help reduce code duplication
Allow caching of routes/matches
Be able to generatePath() for a router for use in templates
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Convert test pages to views/controllers
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
