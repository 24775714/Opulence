Need to add cluster AND multiple-client support for Redis (two different things)
    Issue is that this will potentially require multiple Client objects
    Currently, my Predis EXTENDS the Client class.  It'll need to change to CONTAIN one/many Client classes, and resort to magic methods to pass onto the correct Client objects depending on which connection is being queried.
    Add ability to set prefixes in Server objects
        Add ability to set ANY option in array, use this array to set all the appropriate data in Redis
Review view docs, move some inline code into paragraphs to make it easier to read
Add ability to start a section and show it
    Basically, allows us to define a section and give it default content
    Also, look into whatever is forcing us to copy/paste JS code on opulence's main website
Need to finalize view library name, console name
Run checksetup.php ONLY on post create-project script
Need to add way to test Middleware (1.0)
Get rid of dependence on HTTP Request in Credential stuff
Finish form stuff
