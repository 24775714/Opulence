Need default controller support in Router
Need to figure out what exactly should be returned by Controllers
    Responses?  What does that actually even mean?
Allow caching of routes/matches
Be able to generatePath() for a router for use in templates
Consider using Configs for controllers
    In the config, you'd specify the repos, credentials to use
Once the above is done, need to finish Login controller
    Waiting on ways to resolve dependencies in constructor, first
Think of more application config data, update ApplicationConfig::isValid()
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Cache rendered templates
Convert test pages to views/controllers
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
