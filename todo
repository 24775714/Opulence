Think more about Tokens class
    As is, it is useful for things like validating an authentication token, but doesn't offer methods useful for storage to repositories (HMAC is meant for verification, not storage in repos)
Implement SQLRepo for Tokens
    This will involve hashing the token before storing it - I need to write code to do this
Find way to pass in private user key to Token repos
Implement Credentials concrete class
Implement credentials validator
Add a layer in front of the server connection layers
    This will allow us to one day add in load balancers
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
Need to add logic to actually authenticate requests with api keys and HMACs
