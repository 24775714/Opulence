Problem:  compiling view adds more variables to view
    When caching, we use the vars set BEFORE compilation
    Issue is when we retrieve from cache, we still only have the vars set BEFORE compilation
    Ideally, we'd cache views with vars set BEFORE compilation, but also store vars set after compilation
    Is there a better way??
