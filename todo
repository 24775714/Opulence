Figure out what needs to be done in postRollback for registered aggregate root children
Make sure that UoW and DMs are using same connection
Need to see if there's a way for you to add an item to the repo and use it's Id before uow is committed
    See if we can add a uow::transaction(function()) function that would allow a user to manually do the stuff that's in commit()
    Might need to write methods to make it easier to insert/delete/update individual entities (right now those methods handle lists of entities)
Switch to Monolog for logging
Need to write some interfaces around LoginCredentials and its factory to generalize them
    This will make classes like LoginController and Session able to work with different types of credentials
See if current Session class would make more sense as an abstract class
    Also need to add methods for setting things like cookies/JSON response for credentials
    Need to pass a reference to this object to LoginController
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Write tests for Router class
Need to build classes to store credentials client-side (eg cookies/JSON)
    Where should these classes be instantiated/used?
Need to build classes that instantiate our repos/factories
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
