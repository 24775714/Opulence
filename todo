HAS PRIORITY:
    Run checksetup.php ONLY on post create-project script
    Need to add way to test Middleware (1.0)
    Get rid of dependence on HTTP Request in Credential stuff
    Finish form stuff
    Idea:  Run statement compiler
        Cache results
        Run all other subcompilers
        Cache results
        Next time the template needs to be rendered, look it up in cache
            If it's there, grab it, then check if it is also in cache with the input tags/vars

        ** WOULD NEED TO INHERIT VARS/TAGS/PARTS FROM PARENTS AFTER TEMPLATE IS PARSED
            If we do this inside the Statement subcompiler, we couldn't handle the case when {{username}} was set in a builder for the parent template
                The cached template would always use the inherited tags/vars/parts from the template in cache, which is not at all what we want
            So, we'd need to parse the statements and keep track of the inheritance stack somewhere
                This would also involve running builders AFTER template has been parsed
            Is all this really worth it?
    Add ability to start a section and show it
        Basically, allows us to define a section and give it default content
