HAS PRIORITY:
    Need to consider whether or not to remove Config from Database classes
        I think this is one place that they might prove useful, but think about it
    Need to add URLGenerator
        Try and re-use RouteCompiler to insert variables back into path
    Rethink how we add css/js to templates
        Shouldn't have to have methods in the Template class
        Add built-in template methods to display CSS/JS
            Question is how/where do we specify the list of CSS/JS files for the header/footer?

Need to add more TypeMapper methods
Need to create session storage classes
    Need to think of how to assign session Ids
    For cache-backed sessions, maybe it's best to have a simple ICache for Redis and Memcached to to implement
        This would only include the basics: get(), set(), and delete()
Do we really need repo interface examples in RDev?
    Is this best left for Project?
Implement at least a basic console kernel
Allow caching of routes/matches
Need to write documentation on Request/Response
Incorrect username entry is faster, allowing timing attacks
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
