Implement UoW
    Need to try instantiating a data mapper and injecting it into a Repo
    Need to test that the references are working in UoW so that checkForUpdates() works correctly
    Need to test out all the methods in UoW
        Probably best to unit test
        Going to need to make sure that all the various property arrays are being set correctly by all the methods
    Need to test a getById to see if it can grab an already-managed entity
Once this is all working, need to create Controller classes to instantiate repos and data mappers
    Then, convert existing repos to use them
Switch to Monolog for logging
Need to write some interfaces around LoginCredentials and its factory to generalize them
    This will make classes like LoginController and Session able to work with different types of credentials
See if current Session class would make more sense as an abstract class
    Also need to add methods for setting things like cookies/JSON response for credentials
    Need to pass a reference to this object to LoginController
Need to figure out where to store lifetime settings for login credentials in LoginController
Get rid of "deactivate()" methods because they aren't a good fit for repository pattern
Write tests for Router class
Need to build classes to store credentials client-side (eg cookies/JSON)
    Where should these classes be instantiated/used?
Need to build classes that instantiate our repos/factories
Really need to take a look at DBUnit for this stuff because this is only going to get harder and harder to write tests for
Need to determine how we hand out api keys
